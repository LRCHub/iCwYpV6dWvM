(H. McDonald/S. Bailey)

I don't why I feel this way
They say it must be love
I talked to everyone but you
And you know what we're talking ofI can't get you out of my mind
There's so much more that I want you for
And I need your love
I want you for mine, mine

Take me to your heart
I'm the kind of girl who needs your love and attention
With everything you've got
You're the kind of guy who gives me that sensation

Emotions are so hard to hide
I know I've betrayed my heart
I wasn't going to walk in blind
I tried right from the start
Ooh but you broke my defences down
And you left me wanting more
I got by on my own just find
And I know what it is I need you for
